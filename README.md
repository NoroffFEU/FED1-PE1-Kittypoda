# FED1 Project Exam 1 - Hungry Eyes

Hungry Eyes is a food and travel blog where a handful of bloggers travel around the world to discover some of the world's hidden culinary experiences. Hungry Eyes loves greasy, messy, delicious comfort food, often served in a tucked-away back alley. The target audience is young adventurers who have a passion for good food and traveling.
